# Grocer
This project created a program that was able to take input from a file that contained a long list of items in a grocery store, that we used as stock and then turn that list into a more easily digestable format. There were 4 different options available from the menu, these included creating a histogram, creating a list that printed every item on the list and how many times it appeared, and the ability to search a specific item. The fourth option would exit the loop and end the program. 
I think I did a good job of making my code pretty simple. Although this was the last project we did for the course, this code was much easier to understand than the second project that I did in my opinion. This was also my first time using switch and maps in a project, so I was pretty proud of that.
I believe that I could do a better job in making comments. My comments are pretty bare bonesed and just give the general gist of what a line is doing, but I could put more thought into it while doing the coding instead of adding them as an afterthought.
Using maps was the most challenging. I wasn't really sure at first how to use the list provided efficiently, but through a lot of googling and time on StackOverflow I found this solution and it worked fantastically. It allowed my code to be much easier to read and efficient, and I will definitely be adding it to my arsenal from now on.
The use of switch makes this project much easier to update later on down the line. You would just need to add another case in order to add a new command.


CS300:

This Course was incredibly challenging at the start, learning a bunch of new algos and data structures was overwhelming at first, as well as learning big O notation. Eventually, once all the groundwork was laid, I got the hang of everything and come time to create the final project I felt pretty comfortable with the material. I learned how important it is to understand data structures, so that we can always make the correct choice for a project. Choosing the correct structure insures that our code can run as efficiently as possible. I spent a lot of time on Stack Exchange in order to better understand the materials and really be able to break it down more thoroughly.
