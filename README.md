# Grocer
This project created a program that was able to take input from a file that contained a long list of items in a grocery store, that we used as stock and then turn that list into a more easily digestable format. There were 4 different options available from the menu, these included creating a histogram, creating a list that printed every item on the list and how many times it appeared, and the ability to search a specific item. The fourth option would exit the loop and end the program. 
I think I did a good job of making my code pretty simple. Although this was the last project we did for the course, this code was much easier to understand than the second project that I did in my opinion. This was also my first time using switch and maps in a project, so I was pretty proud of that.
I believe that I could do a better job in making comments. My comments are pretty bare bonesed and just give the general gist of what a line is doing, but I could put more thought into it while doing the coding instead of adding them as an afterthought.
Using maps was the most challenging. I wasn't really sure at first how to use the list provided efficiently, but through a lot of googling and time on StackOverflow I found this solution and it worked fantastically. It allowed my code to be much easier to read and efficient, and I will definitely be adding it to my arsenal from now on.
The use of switch makes this project much easier to update later on down the line. You would just need to add another case in order to add a new command.

This Course was incredibly challenging at the start, learning a bunch of new algos and data structures was overwhelming at first, as well as learning big O notation. Eventually, once all the groundwork was laid, I got the hang of everything and come time to create the final project I felt pretty comfortable with the material. I learned how important it is to understand data structures, so that we can always make the correct choice for a project. Choosing the correct structure insures that our code can run as efficiently as possible. I spent a lot of time on Stack Exchange in order to better understand the materials and really be able to break it down more thoroughly.

For me, interpreting user needs is the most difficult part of coding. A lot of my issues in other courses have come from not understanding what it is that a question is asking of me, and user stories resolves that problem a lot. It makes all the information easily accessible and easy to understand, so that I can focus on what really matters, which is coding and solving the problem. Currently, I'm bad about just programming away, and then compiling at the end instead of iterating and working through a program slowly and making sure everything works. I think in the future I'll attempt to use some agile principles in order to ensure that once I start working on bigger projects I'm not making mistakes that I'm missing until the very end and then chasing my tail trying to find it. I think in order to be a good team member, you need to know what you want from others, what they want from you, and be able to communicate that effectively.

My client for this course was The Gaming Room. They are a company looking to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, to different operating systems. We used a software design template in order to plan out our recommendations for this venture, and focused on a cloud-based architecture. I think my recommendations were very good at the end of the course. In the beginning I was kind of doing a lot of guess-work before I knew too much about cloud-based systems, but as the course progressed I learned more and in turn was able to make more solid recommendations for our client. Having clear goals laid out in the design document would be helpful when it comes to development. I would revise my earlier choices if I were to go back and revise my design document. In re-reading it I think it's clear that I lack too much knowledge on cloud-based systems at the time and I think that this type of project benefits from a cloud-based system. I considered the user's needs throughout the software design document, especially near the end of it. It's important to consider a user's needs as well as who the app will be serving when developing not just the design document but also the code itself, as without taking the user needs into account I would have more than likely chosen a more standard system architecture to develop this program on, as I'm more comfortable with it. However, upon learning more about cloud-based systems and the user's needs for expansion, it became clear that a cloud-based system was the way to go as it will allow for easy porting to other OSes in the future.
